# ServletsHomework assignment:
1. When launching the web application, Login page is shown with user and password as index.html;
2. If the user and password is correct (“John”, “12345”), render the form page, otherwise tell the user that they’ve entered wrong credentials;
3. Implement logic, that if we’ll type directly form page URL in the address bar, and we did not enter credentials, form page will not be shown, hence it will force us to do login.
